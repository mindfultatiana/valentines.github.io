# Valentines Day Card
I wanted to create an opensource hosted valentines day card for someone special. 
[Valentines Day Card Here](https://mindfultatiana.github.io/valentinesday2024/)

### Problem: 
Digitally bridging the distance and making something custom. 
-  I wanted something I could send a link from that was a bit more interactive.
-  I wanted it more custom than the digital card creators.

### What I learned:
I was reminded about what it's like to center a div (I haven't worked with css since 2016).
I think this project is special because it's heartfelt and was built with a lot of love for a special holiday.

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages, Prettier

## Steps
### Step 1
Figure out how to make the Valentines Day card:
  - I started off by getting ideas from a tutorial by Jonah Lawrence [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVX7kZ4GM-g). 
  - That taught how to do a Happy Birthday card.
### Step 2
Make alterations to customize it:
-  I changed the colors, text, and image to be about Valentines Day.
-  I added an image from [PNGTree](https://pngtree.com/)
-  I decided to adjust the padding for the image and the text.
-  I realized the max-height was stretching the image so I adjusted it to 50% instead of just 40vh
and added a max-width.
### Step 3
Add music player to webpage:
-  I found a public domain song "Good Night" by FASSounds available [Here](https://pixabay.com/music/).
-  I found a tutorial on adding a song to your webpage with HTML by Geek Tutorials [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F49XgzlZgA).
### Step 4
Set up GitHub Pages
-  I followed instructions on how to create the GitHub Page [Here](https://pages.github.com/) and [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
-  It's launched and it looks amazing!
